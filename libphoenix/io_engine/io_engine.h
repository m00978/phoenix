 * Pluggable batch I/O engine abstraction (internal to libphoenix).
 *
 * The public phxfs_read_batch/phxfs_write_batch entry points dispatch to
 * whichever engine was selected at runtime. Engines are ranked by
 * preference; the first one that probes successfully wins:
 *
 *   io_uring  -> best on kernels that support it (default)
 *   sync      -> pread/pwrite loop, always-available fallback
 *
 * Each request's target buffer has already been resolved to a host
 * virtual address the kernel can DMA into (GPU P2P VMA or CPU buffer),
 * so engines only deal with (fd, host_addr, nbytes, f_offset).

 * call. 1GiB is a clean, 64KiB-aligned value well under that cap.

 * Batch I/O thread pool
 *
 * A batch of already-resolved requests is handed to a small, fixed set of
 * worker threads that claim contiguous chunks of it, each running the active
 * engine's submit_batch on its own thread_local ring. Multiple independent
 * rings can submit/reap concurrently, which is what lets one top-level call
 * reach an array's aggregate bandwidth (a single ring saturates at most one
 * device); it also lets a single call cross the Python GIL once instead of the
 * caller managing threads.
 *
 * Workers pull from all live jobs round-robin and never synchronise on a job
 * boundary, so back-to-back batches keep the device queue full and a small
 * batch is not stuck behind a large one. See io_pool.cpp for the details.
 *
 * There is deliberately no NUMA-based routing here: the actual P2P transfer
 * is device-to-device DMA (NVMe controller -> PCIe -> GPU BAR) that never
 * touches host RAM, so which CPU/node issues io_uring_submit() has no bearing
 * on that data path. Pinning workers to "the GPU's NUMA node" would, if
 * anything, be pinning to the wrong device's node whenever the GPU and the
 * NVMe backing the fd are not on the same node.
