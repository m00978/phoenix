/*
 * Batch I/O thread pool.
 *
 * A fixed set of PHXFS_POOL_THREADS worker threads, each running the active
 * engine's submit_batch on its own thread_local ring. Workers pull chunks of
 * work from the live jobs, so N rings issue I/O concurrently and reach the
 * storage array's aggregate bandwidth ceiling, while the caller makes one
 * (blocking or async) call and crosses the Python GIL once.
 *
 * Workers are NOT pinned to any NUMA node: the P2P transfer this pool exists
 * to drive is device-to-device DMA that never touches host RAM, so the CPU a
 * worker runs on has no effect on that data path (see io_engine.h). The only
 * job of this pool is fanning a batch out across enough independent rings.
 *
 * Scheduling model (shared work queue, no per-job barrier):
 *   - Every submitted job joins a bounded FIFO of *live* jobs. A worker claims
 *     a chunk of a job's ops (ceil(n / workers), capped at
 *     PHXFS_POOL_CHUNK_MAX), runs that chunk to completion on
 *     its own ring, accounts the results, and claims again.
 *   - There is no barrier between jobs: a worker that exhausts one job's ops
 *     immediately claims from the next, so the device queue does not drain at
 *     a job boundary. (The previous model ran one job at a time across all
 *     workers and waited for every worker before promoting the next job, which
 *     emptied the device queue once per job — visible as a PCIe bubble per
 *     staging group.)
 *   - Claiming is round-robin over the live jobs, so a small batch submitted
 *     behind a huge one (e.g. another GPU's worker) makes progress right away
 *     instead of waiting behind it (no head-of-line blocking).
 *   - A chunk is a contiguous index range, so the worker hands the engine a
 *     slice of the caller's array directly — no copy — and the offsets it
 *     issues are sequential, which suits merging in the block layer.
 *   - Each job carries its own result state (claimed/completed/failed/err);
 *     results are read by that job's wait(), decoupled from scheduling.
